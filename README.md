# py-sudoku (console)

## üìô Description
A simple Python program that generates and solves Sudoku board (9x9) puzzles.

### üìè Scope
The goal of the project was to examine Python's basic syntax and provide added educational value.

The first part of the project was to create a sudoku board solver.
A sudoku board generator was later added to the project.

# üö© Usage

### Generating a Sudoku board
```py
from Sudoku import SudokuBoardGenerator, SudokuBoardSolver, print_board

puzzle = SudokuBoardGenerator()    # Generator initializion.
puzzle.generate_unsolved_board(5)  # Sudoku board generation (difficulty = 5 attempts).
print_board(puzzle.board)          # Printing the result.

# Generating a new Sudoku board to solve...
# generated a new board in 1.1324846744537354 seconds

# 0 0 3 | 0 5 4 | 2 0 9
# 0 9 1 | 3 0 2 | 4 8 0
# 0 8 4 | 0 9 0 | 0 0 0
# ------|-------|------
# 8 0 6 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0

# 0 0 0 | 0 1 5 | 0 0 8
# 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 7 0
```

### Solving a Sudoku board
Solving a board that has been pre-generated by the algorithm.
```py
from Sudoku import SudokuBoardGenerator, SudokuBoardSolver, print_board

# using the generated "puzzle"
puzzle = SudokuBoardGenerator()          # Generator initializion.
puzzle.generate_unsolved_board(5)        # Sudoku board generation (difficulty = 5 attempts).

solver = SudokuBoardSolver(puzzle.board) # Solver initializion.
solver.solve_board()                     # Sudoku board solution.
print_board(solver.board)                # Printing the result.

# Generating a new Sudoku board to solve...

# ------|-------|------
# 8 7 6 | 5 3 9 | 1 4 2

# 9 1 8 | 2 6 3 | 5 7 4
```

### Importing boards
You can also import Sudoku boards from an outsourcer.
```py
from Sudoku import SudokuBoardGenerator, SudokuBoardSolver, print_board
